# Course Module - EEI3269 Introduction to Mobile Application Development
## Developed by A.G.Y. Dulaj
Inside this drive link, you’ll find five separate project files I created while following the course modules. Among them, there are some class reports and lab reports included in this folder. Due to storage limitations, I’ve lost a few of the original project files, so this is what I currently have available.<br><br>
You can simply download and unzip the folder, then open it in Visual Studio Code. Use the Expo Go app to test these projects, and you can also use React Native Web to test specific code snippets. Feel free to refer to these code examples for guidance and inspiration as you work on your own projects.<br><br>
If you need more help, don’t hesitate to reach out. I also have my last project saved separately; if you'd like to access it, I can upload it as well.<br>
